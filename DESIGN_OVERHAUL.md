## 🎬 Animation Library

### New Animations Added

1. **fade-in**: Smooth opacity transition
2. **slide-up**: Element slides up while fading in

### Stagger System
```css
.stagger-1 { animation-delay: 0.1s; }
.stagger-2 { animation-delay: 0.2s; }
.stagger-3 { animation-delay: 0.3s; }
/* ... up to stagger-6 */
```

2. **Maintain Animation Style**: Use established easing curves and timings
3. **Apply Gradients**: Use gradient backgrounds on cards and buttons
4. **Add Hover States**: Every interactive element needs hover feedback
5. **Use Shadows**: Consistent shadow usage for depth
6. **Typography Hierarchy**: Use 900/black for headings, 600/bold for subheadings
7. **Spacing**: Use consistent px values (8, 12, 16, 24, etc.)
